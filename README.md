# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumors from MRI scans. It leverages deep learning with TensorFlow and Keras to classify whether a brain MRI image contains a tumor or not.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

Brain tumor detection is a crucial and challenging task in the medical field. This project provides a simple yet effective deep learning-based solution that automates the detection of tumors using MRI images.

The model is trained on labeled MRI scans to classify images into two categories:
- Tumor
- No Tumor

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset used contains brain MRI images classified into two folders:
- `yes/` â€” Images with tumor
- `no/` â€” Images without tumor

> Source: The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle or similar platforms (not included in this repo).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vinil16/Brain-tumor-detection.git
